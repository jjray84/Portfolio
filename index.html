            All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. If all of us valued food and cheer and song above 
            hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But in the end it's only a passing thing, this shadow; even darkness must pass.
            It's dangerous business going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep 
            your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark 
            places; but still there is much that is fair, and though, in all lands, love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps
            the greater. It's not the strength of the body, but the strength of the spirit. Folk seem to have been just landed in adventures, 
            usually - their paths were laid that way. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. 
            And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten.  <strong>Not all those who wander are lost.</strong>
